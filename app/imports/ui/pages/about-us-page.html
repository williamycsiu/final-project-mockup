  <p>The problem: UHM students have a “rapid” churn rate in goods and services. Students leave the dorm for an on-campus apartment and need to get rid of dorm-specific stuff and acquire apartment-specific stuff. Students graduate and need to get rid of stuff because they’re moving off-island. There is therefore a tremendous amount of “campus-specific” goods and services that could be more effectively recycled and reused if there was an effective marketplace for these specific kinds of items.</p>

  <p>The solution: The Manoa Flea Market is an application for UHM students to facilitate buying and selling of student-related goods and services.</p>
